# CNN Image Resolution Enhancement

## Project Overview
This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using Keras to enhance the resolution of images. It specifically investigates the use of convolutional transpose layers for upscaling images in an experimental setup. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of this approach compared to other advanced models like diffusion models and GANs.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   cd your-repo-name
3. **Install Requirements:**
  Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook or use Google Colab to open the project notebook.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute the cells sequentially to observe the model training and predictions.

## Model Architecture

The model utilizes multiple layers of convolutional and convolutional transpose layers to attempt upscaling of images. The architecture details are included within the Jupyter notebook, providing insights into the layer configurations and the rationale behind them.

## Results and Conclusion

The CNN model did not meet the expected performance in enhancing image resolution. The outcomes were inferior to those achieved by more advanced models such as diffusion models or GANs. This approach was also resource-intensive, making it less practical for applications where computational efficiency is essential.

Exploring diffusion models or GANs for image upscaling tasks is recommended, as they deliver superior results and are more resource-efficient.
